ruleId: CIS-APACHE-2.4-8.2
standard: "CIS Apache HTTP Server 2.4 Benchmark v2.0.0"
description: "Ensure the ServerSignature directive is disabled to prevent displaying Apache version information on error pages."
severity: "Medium"
type: "config_check"
target:
  file: "apache2.conf"
  directive: "ServerSignature"
assertion:
  condition: "equals"
  value: "Off"
rationale: "When enabled, the ServerSignature directive appends the Apache version and module information to server-generated error pages. Disabling it prevents attackers from obtaining version details that could be used for targeted exploitation."
remediation: |
  Perform the following steps to disable ServerSignature:

  1. Open the main Apache configuration file (e.g., /etc/apache2/apache2.conf or /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf).

  2. Locate or add the following directive to ensure server signatures are disabled:
         ServerSignature Off

  3. Save the file and verify the Apache configuration syntax:
         $ sudo apachectl configtest
         Syntax OK

  4. Restart Apache to apply the changes:
         $ sudo systemctl restart apache2

  5. Verify the setting by accessing a non-existent page on your site and checking that the error page does not display the Apache version information.
