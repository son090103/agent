ruleId: CIS-APACHE-2.4-3.4
standard: "CIS Apache HTTP Server 2.4 Benchmark v2.0.0"
description: "Ensure all Apache directories and files are owned by the root user."
severity: "High"
type: "file_permission_check"
target:
  path: "/etc/apache2"
  recursive: true
  owner: "root"
assertion:
  condition: "equals"
  value: "root"
rationale: "Restricting ownership of Apache directories and files to the root user prevents unauthorized users or processes from modifying configuration and executable files, reducing the risk of tampering or privilege escalation."
remediation: |
  Set ownership of all Apache directories and files to root:
      # chown -R root $APACHE_PREFIX
  For example, on most systems:
      # chown -R root /etc/apache2
      # chown -R root /usr/lib/apache2
      # chown -R root /var/log/apache2
