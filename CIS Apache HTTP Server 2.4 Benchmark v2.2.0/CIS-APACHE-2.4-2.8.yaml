ruleId: CIS-APACHE-2.4-2.8
standard: "CIS Apache HTTP Server 2.4 Benchmark v2.0.0"
description: "Ensure the Info module (mod_info) is disabled to prevent disclosure of sensitive configuration details via /server-info."
severity: "High"
type: "config_check"
target:
  file: "httpd.conf"
  directive: "LoadModule info_module modules/mod_info.so"
assertion:
  condition: "not_contains"
  value: "info_module"
rationale: "The mod_info module exposes detailed configuration information, including system paths, usernames, and credentials. Disabling it prevents attackers from obtaining sensitive configuration data that could be used to exploit the server."
remediation: |
  Perform one of the following actions:
  • For source builds with static modules, recompile Apache without including mod_info in the --enable-modules option:
      $ cd $DOWNLOAD_HTTPD
      $ ./configure
  • For dynamically loaded modules, comment out or remove the following directive in httpd.conf or related configuration files:
      ##LoadModule info_module modules/mod_info.so
