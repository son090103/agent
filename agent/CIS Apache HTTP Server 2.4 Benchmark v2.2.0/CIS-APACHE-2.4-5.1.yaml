ruleId: CIS-APACHE-2.4-5.1
standard: "CIS Apache HTTP Server 2.4 Benchmark v2.0.0"
description: "Ensure the Options directive for the OS root directory (<Directory />) is set to 'None' to enforce minimal privileges."
severity: "High"
type: "config_check"
target:
  file: "httpd.conf"
  directive_block: "<Directory />"
  directive: "Options"
assertion:
  condition: "equals"
  value: "None"
rationale: "The Options directive controls which server features are available in a given directory. Setting 'Options None' for the OS root directory ensures a minimal privilege policy, reducing the risk of enabling unnecessary or dangerous features such as CGI execution or symbolic link following."
remediation: |
  Edit the Apache configuration to restrict all options for the OS root directory.
  Add or modify the <Directory /> block to contain the following:
      <Directory />
          Options None
      </Directory>
  This enforces a secure default baseline at the root level; specific subdirectories can enable required options explicitly.
