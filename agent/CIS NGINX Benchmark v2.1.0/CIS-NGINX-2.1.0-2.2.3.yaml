ruleId: CIS-NGINX-2.1.0-2.3.1
standard: "CIS NGINX Benchmark v2.1.0"
description: "Ensure NGINX directories and files are owned by root."
severity: "High"
type: "file_permission_check"
target:
  path: "/etc/nginx"
  owner: "root"
  group: "root"
assertion:
  condition: "ownership_equals"
  value:
    owner: "root"
